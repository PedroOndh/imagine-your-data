Understanding users' behaviour of an online store through their searches is essential, especially during sale periods, when we are more active. This analysis allows to **improve** the results shown and to anticipate to the needs of the users in each moment.

As a first analysis of this behaviour, **the chart above shows a comparison between the number of product clicks and the amount of products** added to cart for a fashion store during the start of the summer sales in Spain (July 1, 2017). This graph shows the significant increase of both values ​​when approaching the beginning of the sales, as well as the increase in the number of products added to cart before and after the start of this sales.

As you can see, the days prior to the start of the sales are **very important**, and the fact of offering discounts during these days allows users to get ahead in their purchases.
