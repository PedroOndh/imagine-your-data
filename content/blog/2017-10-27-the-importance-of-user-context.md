In the previous post we introduced the concept of **User Context** and its importance when analysing, identifying and applying **previous User affinities**.

Using this information we are able to improve eCommerce Search by customising its behaviour according to the Browsing History of each User.
In this sense, the chart above shows a clearly favourable comparison that indicates Contextualisation as a basic form of Personalisation in Search is extraordinarily powerful.

1. **Recurrent** Search Users who **have been contextualised (CSU)**

2. **Recurrent** Search Users who **have not been contextualised (Non CSU)**

Using the chart you can see that the performance of __Contextualised Users__ is noticeably better than for those Non-Contextualised Users.
One differentiating aspect of eCommerce Search vs any other type of Search is that there isnâ€™t a notion of absolute relevancy; what is relevant to one user does not have to be relevant to all.

By creating multiple relevancy models through Contextualisation this reality can be shaped into opportunity as this visualisation demonstrates.
