We were interested to find how some end users queries behave through the whole year, and find out from the data if would emerge common patterns. 

With that in mind we decided to select 6 Top Queries from clothing online stores and plot the data and count the frequency and __Findability__, we opted to get data from October 2016 until September 2017.
