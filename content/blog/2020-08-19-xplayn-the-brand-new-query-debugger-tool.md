This new Empathy query debugger tool was designed to quick and easy drive tactical decisions about search results and configuration. It explains in a straight and simple way all the search configurations related to a specific product or query.

That way, any merchandiser or ecommerce manager dealing with search can easily check or explain to anyone the whys and hows of the search results. With an incredible time-to-market, this tool was ready to be used on some Empathy clients in less than one month and it was really well welcomed! Check here how it works:





It is wonderful to see how a new product causes such an impact in its first release. Xplayn tool solves some of the most basic, but at the same time more tedious, problems that Empathy team faces on a daily basis thanks to the following specs:

* An easy-to-use interface that allows users to see the score given to each one of the products. Avoiding manual tasks that require different tools, actions and technical knowledge.
* Visual comparison between the score given to different products.
* Detailed display on how the different scores are assigned to each one of the products.

The great challenge Empathy faced while creating this tool was to find a way in which the product information was presented in an easy, visually and joyful display.
