This new Empathy query debugger tool was designed to quickly and easily drive tactical decisions about search results and configuration. It explains in a straightforward and simple way all the search configurations related to a specific product or query. 

That way, any merchandiser or ecommerce manager dealing with search can easily check or explain to anyone the whys and hows of the search results. With an incredible time-to-market, this tool was ready to be used by some Empathy clients in less than one month. It was really well received! Check out how it works:

It is wonderful to see how a new product causes such an impact in its first release. XplayN tool solves some of the most basic, but at the same time more tedious, problems that the Empathy team faces on a daily basis thanks to the following specs: 

* An easy-to-use interface that allows users to see the score given to each one of the products.Â Client forego manual tasks that require different tools, actions and technical knowledge.
* Visual comparison between the score given to different products.
* Detailed display on how the different scores are assigned to each one of the products.

The great challenge Empathy faced while creating this tool was to find a way in which the product information was presented in an easy, visual and joyful display. XplayN team has worked hard on this, and on its readiness to adapt to any time-to-market requirements.
