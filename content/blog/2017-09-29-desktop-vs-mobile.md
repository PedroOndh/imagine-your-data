<h3>Distribution of Search traffic throughout the day</h3>

<p>As a further part of the comparison between the behaviour of users using <b>Mobile</b> and <b>Desktop devices</b>, we have analysed the distribution of Search traffic throughout the day.</p>

<p>In this case, we have made a comparison between workdays and weekend using the data of <b>last month</b> (September 2017), observing a notable difference during the first hours of the day: between 8 a.m. and 12 p.m. Search traffic on Desktop devices is noticeably higher on workdays than on the weekend; on the contrary, the behaviour when reaching the end hours of the day is practically the same on any day of the week.</p>

<p>Regardless of the comparative between workdays and weekend, you can also see the overall profile of Search traffic throughout the day: users use more Mobile at night and Desktop devices on the rest of the day.</p>
