> You can get more details for each query by mouse-overing and clicking on them.

**User interactions** in Commerce Search tell us a great deal about what may be missing or flourishing on the Store.
By **understanding** behaviour of groups of users, it's possible to identify **trends or opportunities**.

With that in mind, we decided to look how to relate **users Context** (in this case usersâ€™ past behaviour and their preferences) with their **queries** on __Empathy Search.__
Most importantly we wanted to know how well those users profiles correlate with the queries.

We were also looking for a correlation between queries and the user preferences with a metric that shows if the user found what they were looking for on fashion stores.

Having said that, this chart has **3 different layers**:

1. On the first we have the **queries** and their frequency that can be accessed by mouse-hovering the query circle.

2. On a second level we differentiate the **user profile** in two parts:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Style
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Family (two ranks on the users preferences). 

3. And on a third layer we show each **categories** that composes the Style and Family.

Finally, on the right side of each category there is a metric that displays the **success of the query** associated with the user Context.
