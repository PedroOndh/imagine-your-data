The mere mention of Zero Results pages will make most eCommerce retailers feel uneasy as they’re often the single, most common place where an online store will lose visitors who, in many cases, will then not return again.

This is why it’s so important to not only pay attention to but to fully understand the queries that produce a No Results page when dealing with an **eCommerce catalogue and analysing customer demand.** By keeping on top of Zero Results queries, merchandisers can ensure they don’t miss out on any key opportunities and, let’s face it, most of the times, this is what a No Results query represents: a big opportunity.

In fact, Zero Results queries are actually really useful in revealing where things might not be working, and there are many interesting behaviours and insights available within the searches that produce a No Results page.

That’s why we designed the Zero Results visualisation. It helps you to quickly **identify the top 20 queries** that deliver No Results for a selected period and then look at that behaviour compared to a previous timeframe. This is one of the simplest but most loved visualisations, and it’s used by most of our clients to not just mitigate No Results queries but to be able to take corrective actions in the catalogue and site design if required. Take a look at how this works:
