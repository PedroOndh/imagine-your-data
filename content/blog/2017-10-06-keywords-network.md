<blockquote>Please mouse-over a keyword to highlight relations</blockquote>
We were interested to find which **relations** exist across different **queries**, with that in mind we considered just the queries containing more than one keyword, removed all *stopwords* (words that do not carry any relevant information such as *with*, *me* and *I*), and plotted a diagram with the most **frequent keywords**, and their **connections**.
