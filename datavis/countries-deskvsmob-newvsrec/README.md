# Data Visualizations Project: 'iyd-deskvsmob-newvsrec-monthly'


## Getting started

* Run `npm install && bower install` to install dependencies
* Run `gulp serve` to preview and watch for changes
* Run `gulp serve:dist` to preview the production build
* Run `gulp` to build your visualization for production


## Adding a new dependency

When building your awesome visualization, you will typically need to add a dependency (such as d3). To do this, just run `bower install --save <package>` and this dependency will be installed and incorporated to the build process.
